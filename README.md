# Elements-of-Databases
Final project for the cs327e course. 

Course Description:
This course is designed to give students a practical understanding of databases and data systems. The goal is to learn modern data management and data processing techniques through a mix of best practices, experimentation, and problem solving.

The content of the course is organized into three broad areas: 
1) query languages with an emphasis on SQL; 
2) data models from relational to document to graph; and 
3) data engineering, including processing data at-scale.

We will construct several databases ranging from transactional to analytical and everything in between. This work will be implemented on Google Cloud Platform using a variety of databases and data science tools: MySQL, Postgres, Spanner, Firestore, MongoDB, Neo4j, BigQuery, Apache Beam and Dataflow, Jupyter Notebooks, Data Studio.
